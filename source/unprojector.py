    #Anonymous's personal notes:
    # TODO: Possibly change all things called 'output' to 'texture' to make it consistent naming with other functions
    # TODO: Come up with a better name for this function
    # MAYBE todo: eliminate batch size, because we're going to be doing this once for every image anyway...
    # Batch size is technically unnesecary...but it might be nice to keep it, idk...it combines confidence of multiple 
    #    ... scenes very nicely...(ok, I'll keep batch size)
    # TODO: Perhaps keep track of output_sum_of_squares as well (another vector) so that we could output the variance at
    #    ... the same time as we output the sum?
    # The alternative is running this funtion multiple times, and comparing the texture outputs...which is also a totally 
    #    ... valid approach. It doesn't need BS to do that though...
