# TRITON
This repository has the code needed to run the TRITON algorithm. This page is meant for reviewers, and so it is anonymous.

To train it, run the following commands:

```
cd translator
python3 train.py --config configs/alphabet_five_base.yaml
```

You will also need to install some python packages, including:
```
pip3 install torch rp einops numpy opencv-python OpenEXR
```
